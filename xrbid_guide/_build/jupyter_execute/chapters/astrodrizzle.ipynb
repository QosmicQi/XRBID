    "While not strictly necessary, you may find it useful to generate a mosaic of all of the *HST* observations for a galaxy, creating a single image of the full galaxy from the combined individual observations.\n",
    "For example, the galaxy M81 has over 27 unique *HST* fields, not all of which have enough X-ray sources within them that could be used for an astrometric correction (see {ref}`chap:astrometry`). For that reason, I found it useful to combine all of the fields into a single mosaic, so that I could perform an astrometric correction on the entire image using what few reference objects there were. *Even if you don't need a full mosaic*, you should still try to align all of your fields to one another with `tweakreg`, as this will reduce headaches down the line.

This will create a catalog file called something like `cumulative_sky*.coo`, which the algorithm fills with sources as `tweakreg` is running. This file can then be used as the reference catalog for other filters or future `tweakreg` runs.\n",

Since I created test mosaics that were mostly well-aligned, I decided to use one of those as the reference image.

If all values are small, then the fields are already well-aligned and the header does not need to be updated with `updatehdr`. If `dx` and `dy` are smaller than the RMS, but `rot` is significant, then the fields only need a rotation to be well-aligned. If `rot` is small, as is the case in {numref}`fig-tweakreg-stats`, then it is recommended[^3] to rerun `tweakreg` with `fitgeometry='shift'`. Allowing `tweakreg` to do a rotational shift when one is not needed can result in distortions in the field images, causing the final product to look blurry in places (see {numref}`fig-tweakreg-rscale` below), so it's crucial you choose the correct fitting geometry for your needs! \n"

Check your shifts visually with an image processing application. In `DS9`, this can be done by opening an RGB frame (`Frame > New RGB Frame`) and opening overlapping fields under each of the 3 filters (make sure you set the scale to `zscale` in order to see them properly). Check that the stars in their overlapping regions align. Also check if the filters for a single field align with one another, creating a single, coherent color image.
