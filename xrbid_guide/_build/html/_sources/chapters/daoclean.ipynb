    "# Identifying Optical Counterparts to X-ray Sources\n",
    "\n",
    "From this point on, the methodolgy for identifying the best candidate counterpart for each XRB and becomes fairly open ended. While there are still specific steps that need to be taken, there are a countless number of ways to do so! Here, I detail the steps I typically take to optimize my workflow. The details of one's workflow do not matter as long as you accomplish the following: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Identify optical counterparts that fall within 2-$\\sigma$ of each X-ray source; \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Within this population, identify contaminants (i.e. foreground stars, background galaxies), clusters, and point-sources (i.e. candidate donor stars);\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Extract the photometry from clusters and point-sources (AKA stars); \n",
    "\n",
    "4. Estimate the masses of point-sources and ages of clusters to determine the most likely mass classification (low, intermediate, or high) of each XRB; and\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Flag possible supernova remnants (SNR). \n",
    "\n",

    "## Isolating Candidate Counterparts with `DaoClean`\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we've identified all *HST* optical point sources with `XRBID.AutoPhots.RunPhots()` or `photutils.detection.DAOStarFinder()` and calculated the best positions and 2-$\\sigma$ radii of each *CXO* X-ray source, we can finally select the candidate optical counterparts for each XRB. This is done by isolating all sources that fall within the 2-$\\sigma$ radius of each X-ray source. One can do so manually, but the easiest way is to run `Sources.DaoClean()`. \n",
    "\n",
    "`DaoClean()` works by taking the coordinates of each source in a `DataFrame` (read in as `sources`) and searching for sources in a second `DataFrame` (read in as `daosources`) that fall within a given radius. It returns a `DataFrame` equivalent to that read in as `daosources`, but only containing sources that fall within the search radius of a `sources` source. So, for XRBs in this example, the `DataFrame` given as `sources` would contain each X-ray source, their coordinates, and their calculated 2-$\\sigma$ radii. The `DataFrame` given as `daosources`, on the other hand, contains the point sources identified by `RunPhots()` (or `DAOStarFinder()`) in your base filter of choice. \n",
    "\n",
    "Before running `DaoClean()`, you will need to place the coordinates of each `RunPhots()`/`DAOStarFinder()` point source into a new `DataFrame`. This can be done by using `DataFrameMod.BuildFrame()` or `Sources.LoadSources()` on the `.ecsv` data file that was produced in the previous chapter (by default, `RunPhots()` saves this as something similar to `photometry_M101_f555w_acs_full.ecsv`), *but only if you did not apply an additional shift to your region file*. In my case, I decided to apply a shift during the `RunPhots()` phase, because the region files that were produced did not align well to the *HST* images for reason unknown. \n",
    "\n",
    "Because my region files are shifted, and because my X-ray coordinates were aligned to these shifted regions, I need to create a `DataFrame` using the coordinates of those shifted region files. While we're at it, one may find it's a good idea to compile both the `img` and `fk5` coordinates into a single `DataFrame`, for greater flexibility later down the line. "

You can define the name of each catalog the region files represent with the `catalogs` parameter; this defines the headers under which `Crossref()` will save the cross-referencing results for each region file.

    "`Sources.Crossref()` isn't actually very different, functionally, from `Sources.DaoClean()`, except `Crossref` will search through multiple region files (AKA catalogs) at once and add as many extra lines to the `DataFrame` as needed to accommodate all possible associations. Also, `Crossref` will only keep information on the coordinates and ID of each source, and the IDs of sources that may be associated with it in the other catalogs. It is not recommended to use `Crossref` instead of `DaoClean` to find daosources associated with each XRB, because several sources may be found within each XRB 2-$\\sigma$, and they way the IDs of point sources in each catalog are organized may give the false impressions that they are associated with one another across catalogs (e.g. in a single line in the resulting `DataFrame`, you could have an F555W ID from one nearby star, an F435W ID from another, and an F814W from a third; test it out using both `Crossref` and `DaoClean` to see what I mean). This is only mitigated by reducing the search radius, which I do in `Crossref` below. \n",

For example, a source that's saturated in one filter may appear as multiple sources in a filter with a shorter exposure time. `Crossref()` keeps track of every possible association, so it's likely that `DaoCleanMatch` ends up longer than `DaoCleanFrame`. Keeping the search radius low (the default is 3 pixels) is one way to prevent this as much as possible, which is what we'd want in this case.\n",

    "One of the things you will want to keep in mind is that some of the work you may find yourself doing here may have already been done by other studies. In particular, keep an eye out for cluster and SNR catalogs that have been published by other groups. If those exist, you will want to download those catalogs and extract the coordinates of clusters/SNRs that they've identified. You should then create a DS9 region file of those sources with `WriteScript.WriteReg()`. This will become important as you attempt to classify the optical counterparts of each X-ray source, as they can help inform your final classifications.\n",
    "\n",
    "If there is one or more catalog that you can use in your own research, you will likely find it useful to cross-reference the sources in your sample to sources in those catalog. As discussed above, `Crossref()` takes in a `DataFrame` containing source coordinates (e.g. a `DataFrame` of your X-ray sources) and and cross-references them with sources within one or more given region file. This makes is useful not just for finding matches across filters, but across different types of source catalogs.\n",
