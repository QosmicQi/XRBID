# XRBID: A Guide to Direct X-ray Binary Analysis

This guide is an introduction to my personal methodology for the direct detection and analysis of X-ray binaries in nearby galaxy using the *Chandra X-ray Observatory* (*CXO*) and the *Hubble Space Telescope* (*HST*), as developed and used for my Ph.D. Thesis. As of writing, I used these techniques (or some version of them) in {cite:p}`hunt21`, {cite:p}`hunt22`, and {cite:p}`hunt23`. I imagine as more galaxies are analyzed in this way, better techniques will be settle upon, and I will try to update this document accordingly. 

I intend for this to be a totally comprehensive analysis guide that includes everything from installing `CSC` to pulling data from the HLA, to what kind of things can be done to analyze the data. This guide will also include experimental codes I've entertained, which may hopefully lead to breakthroughs that will make this entire survey exponentially faster to compile. 

## About XRBID Code

Throughout this guide, the user will be provided with examples on how to use XRBID to conduct this XRB analysis research. This relies on custom `python` functions accessible through the XRBID GitHub repository: https://github.com/QosmicQi/XRBID

Before starting this guide, one should follow the instructions on the repository README file to install XRBID and obtain the custom functions and auxiliary data files (or download them directly from the XRBID directory). Since this project is under active development (as of 2025), one should also update their version of XRBID frequently. A quick-reference breakdown of the functions used in this guide will be added to the end of the guide at a later date.
