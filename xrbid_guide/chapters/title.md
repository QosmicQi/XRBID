# XRBID: A Guide to Direct X-ray Binary Analysis

This guide is an introduction to my personal methodology for the direct detection and analysis of X-ray binaries in nearby galaxy using the *Chandra X-ray Observatory* (*CXO*) and the *Hubble Space Telescope* (*HST*), as developed and used for my Ph.D. Thesis. As of writing, I used these techniques (or some version of them) in {cite:p}`hunt21`, {cite:p}`hunt22`, and {cite:p}`hunt23`. I imagine as more galaxies are analyzed in this way, better techniques will be settle upon, and I will try to update this document accordingly. 

I intend for this to be a totally comprehensive analysis guide that includes everything from installing `CSC` to pulling data from the HLA, to what kind of things can be done to analyze the data. This guide will also include experimental codes I've entertained, which may hopefully lead to breakthroughs that will make this entire survey exponentially faster to compile.
