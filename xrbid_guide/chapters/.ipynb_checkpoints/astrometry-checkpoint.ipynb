    "# Astrometric Corrections\n",
    "\n",
    "Because we are combining the data from two different instruments, there are corrections that must be made to the coordinates of the X-ray sources such that it is propely in line with the coordinate system of *HST*. There will be some intrinsic amount of uncertainty in the XRBs' coordinates due to the differences in the X-ray and optical resolution of their respective instruments. These are accounted for by defining 1- and 2-$\\sigma$ regions around each XRB, which trace out the regions within which we are 68% and 95% sure that the source falls. These regions are calculated using the information obtained through the astrometric correction process --- namely, the standard deviation of the median offset between optical and X-ray coordinates. This Chapter outlines how to conduct an astrometric correction and calculate the 1- and 2-$\\sigma$ positional uncertainty regions around each XRB. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Calibrator Selection\n",
    "To calibrate between X-ray and optical source coordinates, we need to select a sample of optical sources that we are reasonably certain are producing the X-ray emissions we detect. These include background galaxies (AGN and quasars), foreground stars, and isolated globular clusters (for example, {numref}`fig-astrometric-calibrators`). To find these sources, we must plot the coordinates of each X-ray source onto the *HST* image. We then identify the X-ray sources and their optical counterparts that are best suited for the assessment. You will want to pull the coordinates for each selected X-ray source, and (if you choose to do a by-hand correction) their associated optical source. \n",

    "Examples of X-ray sources that can be used as calibrators for the astrometric correction. The first 3 images are of AGN and quasars, based on their shapes and/or extremely red colors. The 4th is a foreground star, identifiable by the diffraction spikes. The last is a (somewhat) isolated globular cluster, based on the shape, color, and size relative to typical stars in M101.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Correction Calculation and Application\n",
    "As you may have guessed, I've written a function that will calculate the astrometric corrections automatically, called `CorrectAstrometry`. It takes in the coordinates of your selected X-ray sources (`cat_coords`) and finds the nearest optical source from the coordinates of some base catalog (`base_coords`, which in this case are the coordinates from the `DAOStarFinder` catalog from {ref}`sec:runphots`). Alternatively, you can calculate the astrometric correction yourself by hand-selecting the best optical source position of each calibrator and finding the median x- and y-coordinate offset between the optical and X-ray positions, as well as the standard deviation of those offsets. \n",
    "\n",
    "If the standard deviations on the offsets are larger than the median offsets, then that suggests the *CXO* sources are already well-aligned with the *HST* image and no coordinate shift is necessary. The standard deviations on those shifts, however, are still needed to calculate the positional uncertainties, as it represents the variations in where the optical counterparts fall with respect to the X-ray coordinates of the selected sources. Ideally these will be small, but they're expected to be non-zero. \n",
    "\n",
    "Below is the code I use to find the X-ray calibrators and call `CorrectAstrometry` to calculate the correction: "

This is defined by 1- and 2-$\\sigma$ radii, representing the region within which the source has a 68% and 95% chance of being found. \n",

    "There are two components that go in to the positional uncertainty estimation: the X-ray positional uncertainty, and the standard deviation on the astrometric correction above. The X-ray positional uncertainty is due to the fact that the PSF of *CXO* increasingly degrades for sources that are an increasing distance from the telescope's main pointing at the time of the observation. That is, the farther the X-ray source is from the center of the image, the harder it is to tell where those detected X-rays came from. \n",
