    "X-ray sources that are associated with point sources (i.e. stars) or compact star clusters and that are not flagged as SNR are considered genuine XRBs. The masses of their donor stars, then, are obtained by comparing their photometry across the filters available to us to stellar evolutionary models. The most useful tools for this process are color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) and color-color diagrams (CCDs). The former is used to estimate the mass of isolated XRBs, while the latter allows us to approximate the most likely donor star mass of XRBs that exist within compact star clusters. \n",
