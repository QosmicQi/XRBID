    "While not strictly necessary, you may find it useful to generate a mosaic of all of the *HST* observations for a galaxy, creating a single image of the full galaxy from the combined individual observations.\n",
    "For example, the galaxy M81 has over 27 unique *HST* fields, not all of which have enough X-ray sources within them that could be used for an astrometric correction (see {ref}`chap:astrometry`). For that reason, I found it useful to combine all of the fields into a single mosaic, so that I could perform an astrometric correction on the entire image using what few reference objects there were. *Even if you don't need a full mosaic*, you should still try to align all of your fields to one another with `TweakReg`, as this will reduce headaches down the line.

    "## Aligning HST Fields with `TweakReg`\n",
    "\n",
    "When aligning *HST* fields, I prefer to align each filter separately. I don't actually know if this is a required step, but I feel it allows for better control and prevents too much memory to be used up at once. In order to ensure each filter is aligned to one another, you should define a single reference file, which is controlled with the `refimage` parameter. In this example, I choose to use the first alphabetical `FITS` file for the F555W filter, but there may be various reasons to be more discerning with your file choice. In general, it's a good idea to use a field that has very good observations as your baseline, so doing a quick visual inspection of your fields before starting this process never hurts. \n",
    "\n",
    "One more thing to note: It's a good idea for your first run to have `expand_refcat` and `writecat` both set to `True`, if your computational resources will allow. This will create a catalog of stars against which the remaining fields can be matched, making it more likely for your mosaic to come out successfully. The reference catalog will be saved as `cumulative_sky_refcat_*.coo` and can be called with the `refcat` parameter (be sure to set `expand_refcat=False` and `writecat=False` for the remaining `TweakReg` runs). You may need to increase the `threshold` parameter to save on computational resources while generating the reference catalog file, but this can be adjusted in subsequent runs."
